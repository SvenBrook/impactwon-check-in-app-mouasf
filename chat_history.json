Initial Plan & Feature Breakdown**\n\nThis plan focuses on building the core structure and UI elements for the app. We'll aim for a functional prototype in the first iteration, focusing on data capture and display.\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n*   **Welcome/Data Collection Screen:** Collect user's first name, surname, email (required), and mobile (optional).\n*   **Competency Assessment Screens:** Seven sections for Brand Advocate, Investigator, Team Player, Leadership & Ethics, Business Acumen, Products & Services, Sales Planning & Selling. Each section will have its questions with the appropriate rating scales.\n*   **Results Screen:** Display the radar/spider chart with user and benchmark scores, competency list with scores and status.\n\n**II. Design Elements**\n\nBased on your branding guidelines, here's the color palette and design considerations:\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: Off White #FFFDF9\n    *   Headings, Icons, Primary Text: Focus Blue #1F2B73\n    *   Primary Buttons, Key Highlights: Clarity Blue #0D95FF\n    *   Positive Tags: Insight Teal #A6E0C5\n    *   \"Needs Attention\" Tags: Beacon Orange #FF810C\n    *   Background Blocks, Subtle Panels: Sky Blue #C1E6FF\n    *   Subtle Panels: Reliable Lilac #E3D8FF\n*   **Typography:** Modern, clean fonts (consider system default for now, but we can refine later).\n*   **UI Elements:**\n    *   Cards and panels: 25pt corner radius.\n    *   Buttons: Fully rounded pills.\n    *   Subtle shadow on the top navigation bar.\n    *   Top bar with the ImpactWon logo on the welcome and results screens.\n\n**III. Implementation Plan**\n\n1.  **Project Setup:** Ensure the project is set up with React Native and Expo.\n2.  **Navigation:** Implement navigation between the welcome screen, competency sections, and results screen. Expo Router is already in use, so we'll leverage that.\n3.  **UI Components:**\n    *   Create reusable components for input fields (name, email, mobile).\n    *   Develop a component for the rating scale (1-5 and 1-3).\n    *   Design the competency section layout.\n    *   Implement the radar chart using a charting library (research options).\n    *   Create the competency list component with score and status display.\n4.  **Data Handling:**\n    *   Set up the state management for storing user inputs and assessment responses.\n    *   Implement the logic for rescaling the Leadership & Ethics scores.\n    *   Define the benchmark profile values in the code.\n5.  **Supabase Integration:**\n    *   Instruct the user to enable Supabase by pressing the Supabase button, and connecting to a project (they might need to create one in Supabase first).\n    *   Define the \"assessments\" table schema in Supabase.\n    *   Implement the function to save the assessment data to Supabase.\n6.  **Email Functionality:**\n    *   Implement the server function to email the user a summary of their results and the benchmark comparison.\n\n**IV. Code Modification Plan**\n\n1.  **Create new screens:**\n    *   `app/welcome.tsx`: Welcome screen with data collection form.\n    *   `app/competency/[section].tsx`: Dynamic route for each competency section.\n    *   `app/results.tsx`: Results screen with chart and competency list.\n2.  **Modify existing files:**\n    *   `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx`: Update the layout to include the top bar with the ImpactWon logo on the welcome and results screens.\n    *   `components/button.tsx`: Ensure the button component adheres to the specified design (fully rounded pills, Clarity Blue).\n3.  **Create new components:**\n    *   `components/InputField.tsx`: Reusable input field component.\n    *   `components/RatingScale.tsx`: Component for the rating scale.\n    *   `components/RadarChart.tsx`: Component for the radar chart.\n    *   `components/CompetencyItem.tsx`: Component for displaying a competency with scores and status.\n\nNow, let's start by creating the basic screens and navigation.\n\nAfter the coding agent implements the plan, the modalDemos array from app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx should be removed.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-11-15T02:33:17.379287"}, {"type": "search_knowledge_base"}, {"type": "search_knowledge_base"}, {"type": "search_knowledge_base"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Now let me read the current project files to understand the structure:"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "styles/commonStyles.ts", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "components/homeData.ts", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Now I'll implement the ImpactWon Client Expert Check-in app. Let me start by creating the necessary files:\n\n"}, {"type": "file_update", "file_name": "styles/commonStyles.ts", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "text", "text": "\n\n"}, {"type": "file_update", "file_name": "types/assessment.ts", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "text", "text": "\n\n"}, {"type": "file_update", "file_name": "data/competencies.ts", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "text", "text": ">\n\n"}, {"type": "file_update", "file_name": "utils/assessmentUtils.ts", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "text", "text": "\n\n"}, {"type": "file_update", "file_name": "contexts/AssessmentContext.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "text", "text": "\n\n"}, {"type": "file_update", "file_name": "components/TopBar.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "text", "text": "\n\n"}, {"type": "file_update", "file_name": "components/RatingScale.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "text", "text": ">\n\n"}, {"type": "file_update", "file_name": "components/RadarChart.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "text", "text": "\n\nNow let me install the required dependency for SVG:"}, {"type": "dependency_management", "action": "install", "dependencies": ["react-native-svg"], "status": "complete", "success": true, "stdout": "Progress: resolved 1, reused 0, downloaded 0, added 0\n\n   \u256d\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u256e\n   \u2502                                          \u2502\n   \u2502   Update available! 10.16.0 \u2192 10.22.0.   \u2502\n   \u2502   Changelog: https://pnpm.io/v/10.22.0   \u2502\n   \u2502     To update, run: pnpm add -g pnpm     \u2502\n   \u2502                                          \u2502\n   \u2570\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u256f\n\n\u2009WARN\u2009 deprecated @babel/plugin-proposal-export-namespace-from@7.18.9: This proposal has been merged to the ECMAScript standard and thus this plugin is no longer maintained.

Each question has an `id`, `name`, `scale`, and `levels`.\n*   **Benchmark Profile:** The file also defines a `benchmarkProfile` object, which provides benchmark values for each competency.\n*   **Naming Convention:** The benchmarkProfile keys use snake_case instead of camelCase.\n\n**Potential Issues:**\n\n*   **Inconsistent Naming:** The keys in `benchmarkProfile` use snake\\_case (e.g., `brand_advocate`), while the competency names themselves in the `competencies` array use camelCase (e.g., \"Brand Advocate\"). This inconsistency could lead to errors when comparing user scores to benchmark values.\n*   **Scale Values:** The \"Leadership & Ethics\" competency questions use a 1-3 scale for \"Good Core Values\" and \"Integrity\" (LE3, LE4), while other competencies use a 1-5 scale. The application rescales these values to 1-5 before calculating averages. This rescaling logic is implemented in `utils/assessmentUtils.ts`.\n\nI would recommend standardizing the naming convention (preferably to camelCase for consistency) and double-checking the rescaling logic in `utils/assessmentUtils.ts` to ensure it's correctly applied to the \"Leadership & Ethics\" competency.\n"}], "timestamp": "2025-11-15T03:16:09Z"}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Can you fix it?"}]}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "file_tree", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I need more information to fix the code.

The TypeScript interface doesn't include the `levels` property\n2. The component only shows the question title (e.g., \"Authenticity\") but not the detailed level descriptions\n\nLet me fix this by:\n1.
